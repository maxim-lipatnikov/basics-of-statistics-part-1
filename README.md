# Basics of Statistics Part 1 (by Anatoly Karpov)
This repository contains my materials and an outline for one of the most famous statistics courses in Russia by Anatoly Kaprov.

**Anatoly Karpov** is a well-known expert with experience in the top companies, whose courses (including this one) were so popular that he decided to create his own data science online school **karpov.courses**. Currently, the school offers a large number of data analytics and machine learning courses, and is a direct competitor of the largest player in online education - Yandex.

## Course Contents
1. Basic statistical concepts: population, sample, measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of variability (variance, spread)
2. Normal distribution and its properties
3. Central Limit Theorem
4. Confidence intervals
5. Student's T-distribution
6. T-test for comparison of means
7. Testing the distribution for normality
8. One-factor, multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA)
9. Tukey's criterion
10. Pearson correlation
11. Linear regression (conditions of using, interpretation of results, testing of hypothesis about the relationship between predictors and dependent variable, prediction of values of dependent variable)
12. Classification task (logistic regression and cluster analysis - basic concepts)
13. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) (binomial, multinomial, ordinal regression models, Poisson regression, negative-binomial regression, zero-inflated regression, survival regression - overview and logic of each model, application and interpretation of results)

## Tech Stack
1. Python with libraries (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, sklearn, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, lifelines)
2. Jupyter Lab

## Results
The course was 100% successfully completed. During the course, I not only improved my understanding of statistical concepts and methods, but also practiced applying them using Python. At the end of the course I received a certificate, which can also be found in this repository.
